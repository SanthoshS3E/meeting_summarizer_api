Experiment with new payment system.
As many members know, we have had a lot of problems with PayPal.
The company that processes our credit card orders.
This has been very frustrating for us and very frustrating for many of our members.
We apologize for the problems some of you have had with PayPal.
We do have some good news.
Yesterday, we switched to a different system.
We are now trying Google Checkout.
In general, Google is a much better company with much better customer service.
We have talked to them about our needs and concerns.
And we are hopeful that Google's checkout system will be a big improvement.
We plan to test Google Checkout for two weeks.
Then decide whether to switch permanently.
